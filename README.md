## General Information
We work for a consumer finance company that specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application,
the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision i.e., (1) Likely to repay and (2) Not likely to repay (charged-off) .   
- What is the background of your project?
Consumer Finance company is making losses due to bad loans provided to the consumers which are not recoverable(charged-off). Based on the provided dataset, the consumer profiles whose loan is not rejected, do the analysis and provide conclusions/recommendations to the firm.

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
Do the EDA and provide the info of the consumers who are likely to repay the loan so that they can provide the required loan amount to the applicant.
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

## Conclusions
1. The higher the loan amount, the greater the chance of the loan getting defaulted.
2. Higher interest rate leads to higher charged-off or defaulter
3. The higher the installment amounts show the higher the default percentages

## Recommendations
1. Verified applicants are more defaulters which means the verification process is not accurate. This process needs to be revamped.  
2. People with more public derogatory records have more chance of filing a bankruptcy. The lending club should make sure there are no public derogatory records for the borrower.
3. Borrowers with mortgage homeownership are taking higher loans and defaulting. The lending club should stop giving loans to this category when the loan amount requested is more than 12000.
